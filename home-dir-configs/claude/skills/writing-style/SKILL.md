# Writing Style for Document Drafting

When drafting documents on Scott’s behalf, follow these patterns derived from his actual
writing across design docs, blog posts, proposals, and daily journals.

## Voice

Scott writes like a senior engineer building a case in real time who wants the reader to
stress-test it.

- **Conversational-professional register.** Confident but genuinely inviting of
  disagreement. Technically fluent without being exclusionary.
- **Concrete before abstract.** Always ground ideas in a specific scenario or example
  before generalizing.
  Lead with a “Motivating Example” before a “General Pattern.”
- **Problem-oriented.** Frame everything around problems to be solved, not tasks to be
  completed. Name problems with memorable handles: “The Live Data Problem,” "The Ground
  Truth Problem."
- **Own opinions with “I.”** "The most promising path I see is GenSim."
  “I remain quite bullish on X.” Shift to “we” for shared challenges: “We need to figure
  out Y.”
- **Memorable lines emerge from argument.** Each major document should have at least one
  crafted sentence at a structural turning point -- but only when it crystallizes
  genuine insight. Don’t force it.

## Document Structure

- **Opening:** Byline/date -> horizontal rule -> one-paragraph context-setter -> problem
  statement.
- **Headers:** H2 for primary divisions, H3 for subsections.
  Noun phrases or short declarative statements -- “The Live Data Problem,” not “What Is
  The Live Data Problem?”
- **Lists:** Numbered for sequential/prioritized items.
  Bullets for parallel items.
  List items are often full sentences, not just keywords.
- **Tables:** For genuinely tabular data -- multi-dimensional comparisons,
  concern/mitigation matrices.
  Not decoration.
- **Closing:** Open questions with explicit unresolved items, next steps with concrete
  actions, or direct reader address inviting feedback ("I warmly welcome any other
  perspectives").

## Formatting Conventions

- **Em dashes** (`--`) for parenthetical insertions and mid-sentence pivots.
  This is the signature punctuation mark.
  Prefer over semicolons.
- **Bold** for key takeaway phrases and the most important sentence in a paragraph.
- **Italics** for emphasis on individual words and for distinguishing conceptual terms
  being introduced.
- **Quotation marks** for loosely defined or newly introduced terms: “Events of
  Interest,” "Something Unusual."
- **Backticks** for all technical terms in prose.
- **Parenthetical asides** for clarifications, caveats, and informal commentary.

## Rhetorical Patterns

- **Problem-solution-complication.** State the problem, present an apparent solution,
  identify why it’s insufficient, present a more nuanced path forward.
- **Concrete-before-abstract.** Lead with a specific scenario, then generalize.
- **Rhetorical questions as section openers.** “What does 'good' look like?”
  -- then immediately answer or provide a framework.
- **Analogies: introduce, use, retire.** When an analogy has served its purpose,
  explicitly close it: “This is where the analogy ends.”
- **Signposting.** Signal what the document is and is not trying to do: “In this
  document, I focus on X. The broader question of Y needs its own consideration.”

## What to Avoid

- **Don’t force quotable one-liners.** If one emerges naturally from the reasoning,
  great. Manufacturing them produces cringe.
- **Don’t over-extend analogies** past their useful life.
- **Don’t use “we” for things that are clearly a personal opinion.** Reserve “we” for
  genuinely shared challenges and plans.
- **Don’t write in his casual/journal voice.** “idk,” "uhh," “oh and” are his private
  thinking voice. Drafts for others use his public voice: still direct and human, but
  more structured.
- **Don’t over-hedge.** One “I think” is honest signaling.
  Three in a paragraph is wishy-washy.
- **No emoji.** No filler words as padding.
- **Don’t bury the lede.** Surface the key insight or recommendation early.
  Structure as problem-solution-complication, not a mystery novel.
